# RazManager

RazManager is a Race Management System (RMS) for slot cars. In this repository, you'll find the client software needed to interact with it as a race organiser, driver, team or anyone else interested in a slot car event.


## Hardware and software requirements

- A computer/device capable of running a 64-bit desktop version of Windows 7/8/10/11, Linux, macOS, iOS or Android. A Raspberry Pi will work, but it needs at least 1GB RAM. The RazManager client is written in Flutter, so for details about supported OS versions, [please read the Flutter supported platforms documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/reference/supported-platforms). In addition to that documentation, for macOS at least 10.14 is required.



## Installation

Currently the client isn't available from an app store, i.e. from the Microsoft Store, from Apple's app store, from Google play or as a Linux snap.
Instead, download a version for your operating system from the release page (link to the right), expand the assets dropdown on the the relase you've choosen, extract the compressed file, and start the excecutable file.


### Windows

After extracting the .zip file, simply start razmanager.exe. You'll get a warning that you're trying to run a file from an untrusted source.
Click on "more information" (or similar), and accept to run it anyway.
